# Question
What's the difference between "semantic" and "non-semantic" elements?

# Answer
    "Semantic" tags tell the browser and screen readers information about the content of the tag. "Non-semantic" does not have any meaning; it does not provide any content about what they have.

# Teacher Feedback

You are correct! The purpose that non-semantic tags hold is to group content together!
